You are extracting clinical factors from pre operative clinical notes that may influence a patient's risk of acute kidney injury when undergoing anestheia during surgery. Focus entirely on factors explicitly mentioned in the notes. Do not infer or add details unless explicitly stated.

Extract factors that may:
- Increase AKI risk, be specific and detailed (e.g., diabetes, obesity)
- Decrease AKI risk, be specific and detailed (e.g., frequent urine output, normal creatinine)
- Indicate AKI severity or complications, be specific and detailed (e.g., doubling creatinine, swelling)

For each factor, provide:
1. The primary descriptor (exact or paraphrased from the note)
2. Synonyms or alternative phrasings
3. Broader generalizations that capture similar concepts

Requirements:
- Each descriptor should be ≤3 words
- Focus on clinically relevant factors
- List specific terms, synonyms, and increasingly general concepts. However, do not state overly general concepts like "protective factor", "risk factor", "low risk", or "high risk" because we are using these terms to brainstorm/learn specific factors that clinicians can use to predict AKI risk.
- Separate items with commas

Note(s):
"{note}"

Do not infer or fabricate details. Base all responses strictly on the medical note text.
