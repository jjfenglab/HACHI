We are fitting a concept bottleneck model (CBM) to predict acute kidney injury (AKI) risk for patients undergoing anesthesia during surgery. The goal is to come up with a few meta-concepts that clinicians can use to easily risk-stratify patients for whether they are at high risk of developing with AKI within 7 days after surgery. As training data, we are using preoperative anesthesia notes to retrospectively extract predictive characteristics of the patients and their planned surgeries. A meta-concept has to be defined in terms of a yes/no question of the form "Does the note mention this patient having…?", "Does the note mention this patient taking…?", or "Does the note mention the surgery…?". Pick meta-concepts that are as specific as possible, without being too broad.

Our team was previously considering the following set of concepts for the CBM:
<question_list>
Does the note mention the patient having chronic kidney disease?
Does the note mention the patient having renal impairment?
Does the note mention the patient undergoing minimally invasive surgery?
Does the note mention the patient undergoing an exploratory laparotomy?
Does the note mention the patient having sepsis?
Does the note mention the patient having an active infection requiring antibiotics?
Does the note mention the patient requiring a blood transfusion during surgery?
Does the note mention the patient having fluid retention?
Does the note mention the patient having an active lifestyle?
Does the note mention the patient having a metabolic disorder?
Does the note mention the patient having normal lung function?
Does the note mention the patient having diabetes?
Does the note mention the patient having a malignancy?
Does the note mention the patient having heart disease?
Does the note mention the surgery being high-risk?
</question_list>

Clinical experts gave the following feedback to our concepts:
<feedback>
* The CBM should encompass concepts from three categories: (i) characteristics of the patient, (ii) medications the patient is taking, and (iii) characteristics of the surgery that together influence the patient’s risk of developing AKI. Up to now, questions regarding medications have not been considered.

* Concepts must be granular and clinically precise. "High risk" or "Heart disease" or "Respiratory conditions" is too vague. You must propose concepts that include clear examples or clinical definitions to guide annotation. Concepts must be written of the format "Does the note mention the patient having ..., e.g., ...?" For instance, phrase questions like "Does the note mention the patient having good exercise tolerance, e.g. having at least 5 METS of functional capacity or ability to climb two flights of stairs?" Similarly, concepts like fluid retention should clarify if it is referring to CHF exacerbation or ascites, such as through concept questions like "Does the note mention the patient having signs of cardiac volume overload, e.g. pulmonary edema, pitting edema, or jugular venous distension?" or "Does the note mention the patient having signs of hepatic fluid accumulation, e.g. ascites or significant abdominal distension?".

* Concepts that the expert believes are likely relevant, but should be assessed against patterns seen in the actual data:
  - Does the note mention the patient having severe.g.,stroesophageal reflux, e.g., esophageal stricture, Barrett's esophagus, or a high risk of aspiration?
  - Does the note mention the patient having normal pulmonary function, e.g., mentions of lungs being clear to auscultation bilaterally?
  - Does the note mention the patient having signs of cardiac volume overload, e.g., pulmonary edema, pitting lower extremity edema, jugular venous distension (JVD), or a history of congestive heart failure exacerbations?
  - Does the note mention the patient having signs of hepatic fluid accumulation, e.g., ascites, significant abdominal distension, or a history of requiring paracentesis?
  - Does the note mention the patient having symptoms of decompensated Heart Failure, e.g., orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND), or a documented Ejection Fraction (EF) < 40%?
  - Does the note mention the patient having poor functional capacity, e.g., lower than 4 METs, inability to climb one flight of stairs, or inability to walk two blocks without shortness of breath?
  - Does the note mention the patient having active or untreated Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), e.g., current angina/chest pain, a recent positive stress test, or significant stenosis that has not been revascularized?
  - Does the note mention the patient having an active systemic infection, e.g., sepsis, bacteremia, fungemia, or a plan to administer therapeutic (non-prophylactic) antibiotics?
  - Does the note mention the patient is currently an inpatient?
  - Does the note mention the expected surgical duration is prolonged, in that it lasts longer than 3 to 4 hours?
  - Does the note mention the patient having bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy, e.g., Hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, liver coagulopathy (INR > 1.5), or active use of therapeutic anticoagulants (e.g.,, Warfarin, Apixaban)?
  - Does the note mention the patient having low hemoglobin, e.g., anemia or hemoglobin < 10 g/dL?
  - Does the note mention the patient having severe baseline respiratory compromise, e.g., the use of home oxygen, home CPAP/BiPAP for reasons other than sleep apnea, or a history of tracheostomy?
  - Does the note mention the surgery having a high risk of major blood loss, e.g., open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, liver transplantation, Whipple procedure, or anticipated blood loss (EBL) > 500mL?
  - Does the note mention the surgery being emergent?
  - Does the note mention the surgery as having a high risk of needing a blood transfusion, e.g., major trauma surgery or transplant surgery?
  - Does the note mention the patient using of potentially nephrotoxic home medications, e.g., high-dose NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, chronic loop diuretics, or antibiotics like vancomycin or gentamicin?
  - Does the note mention the patient using multiple (two or more) nephrotoxic home medications, e.g., high-dose NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, chronic loop diuretics, or antibiotics like vancomycin or gentamicin?
  - Does the note mention the patient taking multiple medications at home?
* Other categories of concepts clinical experts have suggested considering include:
  - ​​Patient characteristics: fluid accumulation, abnormal/ normal pulmonary findings, heart failure symptoms, acid reflux, bleeding disorders, abnormal laboratory values, creatinine levels, multiple medications, active infection requiring antibiotics, functional capacity (e.g., METS score, good exercise tolerance)
  - Pre-surgical status: location prior to surgery (ICU, hospital ward, or home), if the patient is intubated or needs supplemental oxygen
  - Surgical characteristics: anticipated bleeding risk, expected surgical duration, need for blood transfusion during the procedure, certain types of surgery that may be lower or higher risk for developing AKI, emergency surgery
  - Medication characteristics: multiple medications, nephrotoxic medications, antibiotics, insulin therapy
<feedback>

Given this feedback, we conducted an updated data analysis to find the top phrases describing the patient, the planned surgery, and/or the patient's medication status that are most associated with AKI. We did this by fitting a logistic regression model with tf-idf features.
Phrases with top coefficients:

{top_features_df}

YOUR TASK: 
Propose {max_meta_concepts} candidate meta-concepts for a CBM. Do this by analyzing the results from the data-driven analyses and incorporating expert feedback, when appropriate. You can merge, revise, or add new questions. Systematically review the tf-idf top words list. Prioritize concepts that appear in the tf-idf results and align with the feedback guidance.

Do not propose meta-concepts that are simply a union of two different concepts (e.g. "Does the note mention this patient having an infection or being elderly?" is not allowed), questions with answers that are almost always a yes (e.g. the answer to "Does the note mention this patient being hospitalized?" is almost always yes), or questions where the yes/no options are not clearly defined (e.g. "Does the note mention this patient experiencing difficulty?" is not clearly defined because difficulty may mean financial difficulty, physical difficulties, etc).

Propose at least {max_meta_concepts} candidates in the following JSON format:
