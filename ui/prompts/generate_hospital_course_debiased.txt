Here are clinical notes from an inpatient medical-surgical admission at a safety net hospital:
"{note}"

Please create a comprehensive timeline of this patient's hospital course, documenting key events and their timing without making assumptions about their impact on length of stay.

Your timeline should objectively capture:
1. Admission reason, primary diagnosis, and expected treatment course
2. Chronological sequence of major clinical events, procedures, and consultations
3. Any documented delays, gaps, or waiting periods (with specific dates/durations when available)
4. Discharge planning activities and their timing
5. Social, placement, or coordination factors mentioned in the notes

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Document events neutrally - do not assume they extended or shortened the stay
- Include both routine care events AND any deviations from typical workflow
- Note specific timeframes: "MRI ordered Day 2, completed Day 5" rather than "MRI was delayed"
- Use direct quotes or close paraphrases from the notes
- Distinguish between:
  * Expected waiting periods (e.g., "24-hour observation post-tPA per protocol")
  * Unexplained gaps (e.g., "Progress notes Days 3-5 state 'awaiting MRI'")
  * Medical necessities (e.g., "Antibiotics extended due to persistent fever")
  * Non-medical delays (e.g., "Medically cleared Day 7, discharged Day 10")

Focus only on information explicitly stated in the notes. Do not interpret whether events were appropriate or problematic - simply document what occurred and when.
