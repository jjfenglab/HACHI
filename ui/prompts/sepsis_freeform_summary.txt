You are tasked with creating a comprehensive summary of a patient's hospital course for a sepsis admission. Your summary will be used to extract factors that may influence length of stay.

Here are clinical notes from the admission:
"{note}"

**YOUR TASK:**
Write a detailed narrative summary that captures ALL clinically relevant events, decisions, and factors during this hospitalization. Focus on creating a rich, complete picture of the patient's hospital course that includes medical management, system processes, and coordination activities.

**IMPORTANT CONTEXT ABOUT THE NOTES:**
- Progress notes often contain duplicate information from day to day. Treat duplicated text as a single occurrence unless the clinical context clearly indicates repeated events.
- Delays rarely appear explicitly. Instead, look for patterns like:
  * "Awaiting" or "pending" status that persists across multiple notes
  * Gaps between when something is ordered and when it's completed
  * Repeated mentions of the same unfulfilled plan across several days
  * "Continue to monitor" or similar language without progression

**STRUCTURE YOUR SUMMARY USING THESE COMPONENTS:**

**1. Presentation and Initial Management**
- How the patient presented and sepsis was recognized
- Initial severity, vital signs, and organ dysfunction
- Early interventions (cultures, antibiotics, fluids, support measures)

**2. Clinical Course and Evolution**
- How the infection responded to treatment
- Antibiotic adjustments and rationale
- Complications or new issues that arose
- Persistent problems or slow resolution
- Include specific details: which organisms grew, which antibiotics were used, what doses

**3. Procedures, Diagnostics, and Consultations**
- All imaging, procedures, and their findings
- Consultant involvement and their recommendations
- Note timing patterns (e.g., "CT abdomen ordered on day 2, completed on day 4")
- Source control interventions if performed

**4. Care Coordination and System Factors**
- Transfers between units or services
- Coordination between teams
- Resource availability issues (if evident from timing patterns)
- Weekend or holiday effects on care processes

**5. Recovery, Functional Status, and Discharge Planning**
- Mobility and functional assessments
- Discharge criteria and when met
- Barriers encountered (medical, social, or system-based)
- Final discharge plan including antibiotic duration, follow-up needs, DME, or placement

**EXPERT-IDENTIFIED SEPSIS EVENTS (Common but not exhaustive):**
Hospital sepsis experts have identified these as frequently important. Include these when present, but also capture any other relevant events:

- Blood culture collection and results timing
- Antibiotic selection, changes, and route transitions  
- Source identification and control procedures
- Organ dysfunction and support requirements
- Clinical response indicators (fever curves, lab trends, hemodynamics)
- ID or other specialty consultations
- Mobility/PT assessments and progression
- Discharge antibiotic plans and duration
- DME needs and procurement process
- Home health or facility placement activities
- Insurance or authorization requirements

**WRITING GUIDELINES:**
- Within each section, write flowing narrative paragraphs (not bullet points)
- Describe events factually and completely
- When you identify timing patterns suggesting delays, describe them naturally (e.g., "MRI was ordered on hospital day 2 but completed on day 5")
- Preserve specific medical terminology and details from the notes
- If a section has minimal relevant information, keep it brief but include it for consistency
- Connect related events across sections when appropriate

Create a comprehensive narrative that captures the complete hospitalization story while maintaining consistent organization across different patients.
