Here are clinical notes from an inpatient medical-surgical admission at a safety net hospital:
"{note}"

Please provide a detailed summary of this patient's hospital course with particular attention to factors that may have prolonged their length of stay beyond what would be typical for their diagnosis.

Your summary should include:
1. Brief overview of admission reason and primary diagnosis
2. Timeline of key events during the hospitalization
3. Any complications or setbacks that occurred
4. Barriers to discharge (medical, social, or system-related)
5. Delays in care delivery (tests, procedures, consultations)
6. Social or placement issues affecting discharge planning
7. Care coordination challenges

Be specific about WHEN and WHY delays occurred based on the information in the notes. Use direct quotes or paraphrases from the notes when possible to support your observations.

Focus only on information explicitly stated or clearly implied in the provided notes. Do not make assumptions about factors not mentioned. You do NOT need to provide a conclusion sentence to your summary.
