You are extracting specific factors from a hospital course summary that may influence length of stay. Your task is to identify ONLY factors that are explicitly mentioned in the provided summary.

Here is a hospital course summary for a sepsis admission:
"{note}"

**YOUR TASK:**
Read the summary carefully and extract factors that actually appear in THIS patient's course. Create concept phrases that could be used to identify similar factors in other patients.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Only extract factors that are EXPLICITLY described in the summary above
2. Do NOT use pre-defined concepts unless they match what's in the summary
3. Each concept should complete: "Does the note mention/describe ____?"
4. Make concepts specific enough to be meaningful but general enough to apply to other patients
5. For each concept, provide 2-3 alternative phrasings (3 words or less each)

**HOW TO IDENTIFY CONCEPTS:**
Look for:
- Specific complications or findings mentioned
- Actual delays or timing issues described
- Real coordination problems encountered
- Concrete barriers to discharge
- Specific treatment challenges noted

**EXTRACTION PROCESS:**
1. First, identify the specific event/factor in the summary
2. Then, generalize it into a concept that could apply to other patients
3. Create 2-3 alternative phrasings

**EXAMPLES OF THE EXTRACTION PROCESS:**
(These are examples to show the method - do NOT use these unless they appear in your summary)

If summary says: "Patient required BiPAP for 5 days due to persistent hypoxia"
→ Extract: "non-invasive ventilation, BiPAP requirement, respiratory support"

If summary says: "Discharge delayed when patient failed swallow evaluation"
→ Extract: "swallow failure, dysphagia assessment, aspiration risk"

If summary says: "Insurance denied SNF placement, requiring case management intervention"
→ Extract: "placement denial, insurance barrier, SNF rejection"

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
{"1": "<descriptor1, synonym1, generalization1>"}
{"2": "<descriptor2, synonym2, generalization2>"}

Remember: Extract ONLY what is actually in the provided summary. If the summary doesn't mention something, don't include it.
