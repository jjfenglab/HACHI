Here is a hospital course summary:
"{note}"
Extract generalizable factors that contributed to this patient's extended length of stay.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Convert specific events from the summary into general concepts that could apply to other patients
2. Each factor should represent a category of delay or barrier, not patient-specific details
3. For each factor, provide 2-3 alternative phrasings or related terms
4. All descriptors must be 3 words or less

Output format - for each factor create an entry like:
{"1": "<STRING_OF_DESCRIPTOR1_AND_SYNONYMS_AND_GENERALIZATIONS>"}
{"2": "<STRING_OF_DESCRIPTOR2_AND_SYNONYMS_AND_GENERALIZATIONS>"}
...

Examples of how to generalize:
- If summary mentions "waited 3 days for MRI" -> Extract: "Imaging delays, Radiology backlog, Test waiting"
- If summary mentions "no beds at local SNF" -> Extract: "Placement difficulty, SNF unavailable, Discharge barrier"
- If summary mentions "cardiology consulted day 5" -> Extract: "Delayed consult, Specialist availability, Late consultation"

Only include factors identified in the summary above.
