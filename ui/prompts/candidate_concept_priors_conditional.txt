We are fitting a concept bottleneck model (CBM) to predict hospital length of stay (LOS) for patients admitted to medical-surgical units at a safety net hospital. Your goal is to help construct a CBM that extracts {num_concepts} meta-concepts to predict if a patient will have a longer than average length of stay. A meta-concept is a binary feature extractor defined by a yes/no question. We have {num_concepts_fixed} meta-concepts so far:
{meta_concepts}
So far, we've fit a concept bottleneck model to predict longer LOS using only the {num_concepts_fixed} existing meta-concepts. We are planning to add one of the following candidate meta-concepts to the CBM to predict longer LOS:
{candidate_list}

Assign a non-zero prior probability for each of the candidate meta-concepts. To help come up with a prior probability, we have used an LLM to summarize each note and fit a bag-of-words model on the summaries to predict the residuals. These are the top features in the residual model, in descending order of importance:

{top_features_df}

Note if two candidate meta-concepts are the same, they should be assigned the same prior probability.

Summarize all the candidate meta-concepts with non-zero prior probabilities at the end with a valid JSON, formatted as follows:
{
    "0": <PRIOR_PROBABILITY>,
    "1": <PRIOR_PROBABILITY>,
    ...
}
Example:
{
    "0": 0.1,
    "1": 0.4,
    ...
}
