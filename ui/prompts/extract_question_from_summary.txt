Here is a hospital course summary:
"{note}"

Extract generalizable factors that contributed to this patient's extended length of stay by creating concept questions.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Each concept should complete the question: "Does the note mention/describe ____?"
2. Focus on specific, observable factors that could delay discharge or extend LOS
3. Make concepts binary (clearly yes/no answerable) and specific enough to avoid ambiguity
4. For each concept, provide 2-3 alternative phrasings that would identify the same underlying factor
5. Each phrase must be 3 words or less

Output format - for each factor create an entry like:
{"1": "<STRING_OF_DESCRIPTOR1_AND_SYNONYMS_AND_GENERALIZATIONS>"}
{"2": "<STRING_OF_DESCRIPTOR2_AND_SYNONYMS_AND_GENERALIZATIONS>"}
...

Examples of concept questions:
- If summary mentions "waited 3 days for MRI" -> Extract: "imaging delays, delayed radiology, pending scans"
  (Completes: "Does the note mention/describe imaging delays?")
- If summary mentions "no beds at local SNF" -> Extract: "placement barriers, SNF unavailability, facility waitlist"
  (Completes: "Does the note mention/describe placement barriers?")
- If summary mentions "family disagreement about care" -> Extract: "family conflict, decisional discord, care disagreement"
  (Completes: "Does the note mention/describe family conflict?")

Guidelines for good concepts:
- Specific: "insurance denial" NOT "insurance issues"
- Observable: "missed appointments" NOT "poor compliance" 
- Binary: "substance use" NOT "patient factors"
- Actionable: "equipment unavailable" NOT "resource problems"

Only include concepts clearly supported by the summary above.
