Here are clinical notes from an inpatient sepsis admission at a safety net hospital:
"{note}"

Please create a comprehensive timeline of this patient's hospital course, documenting key events and their timing without making assumptions about their impact on length of stay.

SEPSIS-SPECIFIC DOCUMENTATION GUIDANCE:
Focus on capturing the complete sequence of sepsis management events, regardless of when they occur:

**Initial Management Phase:**
- Admission trigger and sepsis recognition
- Timing of initial workup components (blood cultures, lactate, urine culture, other cultures)
- Antibiotic initiation (type, route, timing relative to cultures)
- Fluid resuscitation details
- Initial severity indicators (vital signs, organ dysfunction)

**Monitoring & Response Phase:**
- Culture results and sensitivities (when received, what grew)
- Lactate trends and repeat timing
- Clinical response markers (fever curve, WBC trend, hemodynamic stability)
- Antibiotic adjustments (narrowing, broadening, or changes)
- Organ support needs (vasopressors, ventilation, dialysis)

**Recovery & Transition Phase:**
- Clinical improvement milestones
- IV to PO antibiotic transition (if applicable)
- Mobility and functional assessments
- Telemetry monitoring periods
- Complication development or resolution

**Discharge Preparation Phase:**
- Medical stability criteria met
- Discharge antibiotic plan (duration, route)
- DME needs identified and ordering process
- Home health or facility placement activities
- Medication reconciliation timing
- Follow-up arrangements

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Document ALL events in chronological order, whether routine or unusual
- Include specific dates/times when available (e.g., "Blood cultures drawn 14:30 on Day 1")
- Note any documented waiting periods or process delays without interpretation
- Capture parallel workflows (e.g., "While awaiting culture results, PT consulted on Day 2")
- Include social and system factors that affect care coordination
- Use direct quotes for important clinical decisions or barriers

Document the actual sequence of events as they occurred for THIS patient, not an idealized pathway.
