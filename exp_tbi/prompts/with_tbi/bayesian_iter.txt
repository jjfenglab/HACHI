The goal is to come up with a concept bottleneck model (CBM) that extracts {num_concepts} meta-concepts from clinical notes from the electronic health record of pediatric patients admitted to the emergency room to predict risk of having a traumatic brain injury (TBI). A meta-concept is a binary feature extractor defined by a yes/no question. We have {num_concepts_fixed} meta-concepts so far:
{meta_concepts}

To come up with the {num_concepts}th meta-concept, I have done the following: I first fit a CBM on the {num_concepts_fixed} existing meta-concepts. Then to figure out how to improve this {num_concepts_fixed}-concept CBM, I first extracted a list of concepts that are present in each note, and then fit a linear regression model on the extracted concepts to predict the residuals of the {num_concepts_fixed}-concept CBM. These are the top extracted concepts in the resulting residual model, in descending order of importance:

{top_features_df}

To interpret this residual model, a general rule of thumb is that an extracted concept with a large positive coefficient means that a high risk of TBI is positively associated with the concept being mentioned in the note, and an extracted concept with a negative coefficient means that a higher risk of TBI is negatively associated with the concept being mentioned in the note. 

Given the residual model, create cohesive candidates for the {num_concepts}th meta-concept. Be systematic and consider all the listed concepts in the residual model. Start from the most to the least predictive concept. For each concept, check if it matches an existing meta-concept or create a new candidate meta-concept. Work down the list, iterating through each concept. Clearly state each candidate meta-concept as a yes/no question.

Suggestions for generating candidate meta-concepts: Do not propose meta-concepts that are simply a union of two different concepts (e.g. "Does the note mention this patient having an infection or being elderly?" is not allowed), questions with answers that are almost always a yes (e.g. the answer to "Does the note mention this patient being hospitalized?" is almost always yes), or questions where the yes/no options are not clearly defined (e.g. "Does the note mention this patient experiencing difficulty?" is not clearly defined because difficulty may mean financial difficulty, physical difficulties, etc). Do not propose meta-concepts where you would expect over 95% agreement or disagreement with the {num_concepts_fixed} existing meta-concepts (e.g. "Does the note mention the patient having homelessness?" overlaps too much with "Does the note mention the patient having housing insecurity?").

Finally, summarize all the generated candidates for the {num_concepts}-th meta-concept in a JSON. Merge any candidate meta-concepts that are essentially the same (where you would expect over 95% agreement) or essentially opposites (you would expect over 95% disagreement). In the JSON, include a list of comma-separated list of phrases that mean the same or opposite of each candidate meta-concept. Propose at least ten candidates. The final JSON should have the following format:

Propose at least six candidates in the following JSON format:
{
  "reasoning": "Step-by-step explanation of how you systematically worked through the model concepts (from most to least predictive) and combined them with the feedback suggestions.”,
  "concepts": [
    {
      "concept": "<QUESTION 1>",
      "words": ["<SYNONYM/ANTONYM 1>", "<SYNONYM/ANTONYM 2>", "<SYNONYM/ANTONYM 3>"]
    },
    {
      "concept": "<QUESTION 2>",
      "words": ["<SYNONYM/ANTONYM 1>", "<SYNONYM/ANTONYM 2>", "<SYNONYM/ANTONYM 3>"]
    },
    ...
    {
      "concept": "<QUESTION 6>",
      "words": ["<SYNONYM/ANTONYM 1>", "<SYNONYM/ANTONYM 2>", "<SYNONYM/ANTONYM 3>"]
    }
  ]
}

Example answer:
{
  "reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning through the residual model concepts and feedback",
  "concepts": [
    {
      "concept": "Does the note mention the patient experiencing head trauma?",
      "words": ["head injury", "skull trauma", "cranial damage"]
    },
    {
      "concept": “Does the note loss of consciousness?”
      "words": ["LOC", "fainting, unresponsive"]
    },
    ...
    ]
}
