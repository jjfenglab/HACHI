You are extracting clinical factors from emergency room medical notes.  Output a list of descriptors that summarizes the patient case (such as aspects of injury, demographics, symptoms, SDOH, etc).  For each descriptor, also list as many descriptors that mean the same thing or generalizations of the descriptor.  All descriptors, synonyms, and generalizations cannot be more than three words. Output as a JSON in the following format. 

For each factor, provide:
1. The primary descriptor (exact or paraphrased from the note)
2. Synonyms or alternative phrasings
3. Broader generalizations that capture similar concepts

Requirements:
- Each descriptor should be ≤3 words
- Focus on clinically relevant factors
- Include both specific terms and generalizable concepts
- Separate items with commas

Note(s):
"{note}"

Do not infer or fabricate details. Base all responses strictly on the medical note text.
