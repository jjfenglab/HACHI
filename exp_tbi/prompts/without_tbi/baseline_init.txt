We are fitting a concept bottleneck model to predict some clinical outcome "Y" for pediatric patients admitted to emergency room. The goal is to come up with {num_meta_concepts} meta-concepts to extract from clinical notes that maximize the accuracy of the concept bottleneck model for predicting whether a patient will have a higher risk of this clinical outcome "Y".

The top words most associated with the clinical outcome were estimated using a simple logistic regression model with tf-idf features. Based on the top words, come up with {num_meta_concepts} meta-concepts. A meta-concept has to be defined in terms of a yes/no question, e.g. "Does the note mention this patient having a fall?". Pick meta-concepts that are as specific as possible, without being too broad.

Suggestions for generating candidate meta-concepts: Do not propose meta-concepts that are simply a union of two different concepts (e.g. "Does the note mention this patient having an infection or being elderly?" is not allowed), questions with answers that are almost always a yes (e.g. the answer to "Does the note mention this patient being hospitalized?" is almost always yes), or questions where the yes/no options are not clearly defined (e.g. "Does the note mention this patient experiencing difficulty?" is not clearly defined because difficulty may mean financial difficulty, physical difficulties, etc).

Words with top coefficients:

{top_features_df}

Propose at least {max_meta_concepts} candidates in the following JSON format:
{
  "reasoning": "Step-by-step explanation of how you systematically worked through the model concepts (from most to least predictive).”,
  "concepts": [
    {
      "concept": "<QUESTION 1>",
      "words": ["<SYNONYM/ANTONYM 1>", "<SYNONYM/ANTONYM 2>", "<SYNONYM/ANTONYM 3>"]
    },
    {
      "concept": "<QUESTION 2>",
      "words": ["<SYNONYM/ANTONYM 1>", "<SYNONYM/ANTONYM 2>", "<SYNONYM/ANTONYM 3>"]
    },
    ...
    {
      "concept": "<QUESTION {max_meta_concepts}>",
      "words": ["<SYNONYM/ANTONYM 1>", "<SYNONYM/ANTONYM 2>", "<SYNONYM/ANTONYM 3>"]
    }
  ]
}

  "concepts": [
    {
      "concept": "Does the note mention the patient experiencing head trauma?",
      "words": ["head injury", "skull trauma", "cranial damage"]
    },
    {
      "concept": “Does the note mention loss of consciousness?”
      "words": ["LOC", "fainting, unresponsive"]
    },
    ...
    ]
}
