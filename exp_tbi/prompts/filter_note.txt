You are reviewing emergency department clinical notes to assemble a dataset where clinical notes are used to predict if a patient has traumatic brain injury prior to conducting a CT scan, as predictions from this model will determine whether or not to give the patient a CT scan.

A patient should be EXCLUDED if:

1. **Prior CT scan**: The patient had a recent CT scan performed at another facility/hospital before arriving at this ED, and results (especially positive findings like brain bleeds, fractures, or other TBI-related findings) are mentioned in the note

2. **Patients with known TBI diagnosis**: The patient already has a current TBI diagnosis or positive neuroimaging findings

3. **Prior admission**: The patient was previously admitted to this or another hospital for the same injury/incident

Focus on identifying cases where the clinical outcome (presence/absence of TBI) would already be known from information external to the current ED encounter.

Return your answer as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "exclude": true or false,
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this case should be excluded, or 'No exclusion criteria met'",
    "evidence": "Specific text from the note that supports exclusion" or null
}

Respond ONLY with valid JSON. Do not include any text outside the JSON structure.
