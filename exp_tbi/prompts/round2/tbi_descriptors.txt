You are extracting clinical descriptors of a pediatric patient from emergency room medical notes that may influence their risk of being diagnosed with traumatic brain injury (TBI).  Focus entirely on factors explicitly mentioned in the notes. Do not infer or add details unless explicitly stated.

Extract factors that may:
- Increase TBI risk, be specific and detailed (e.g., substance use, prior head injuries, loss of consciousness, cognitive delays, history of traumatic brain injury, vomiting, headaches, hematoma, location of hematoma, GCS<15)
- Decrease TBI risk, be specific and detailed (e.g., protective equipment use, medication compliance, GCS=15)
- Indicate TBI severity or complications, be specific and detailed (e.g., seizures, cognitive changes, somnolence)

For each factor, provide:
1. The primary descriptor (exact or paraphrased from the note)
2. Synonyms or alternative phrasings
3. Broader generalizations that capture similar concepts

Requirements:
- Each descriptor should be ≤3 words
- The descriptor should state distinguishing features. Focus on clinically relevant factors.
- List specific terms, synonyms, and increasingly general concepts. However, do not state overly general concepts like "protective factor", "risk factor", "low risk", or "high risk" because we are using these terms to brainstorm/learn specific factors that clinicians can use to predict TBI risk.
- Do not extract concepts that are sensitive to the hospital's operational protocols. So rather than extracting concepts that simply describe patients having a neurological assessment, propose concepts that are characteristics or symptoms of the patient themself.
- Separate items with commas

Note(s):
"{note}"

Do not infer or fabricate details. Base all responses strictly on the medical note text.
