We are fitting a concept bottleneck model to predict traumatic brain injury (TBI) for pediatric patients admitted to emergency room. The goal is to come up with a few meta-concepts that clinicians can use to easily risk-stratify patients for whether they are at high risk of being diagnosed with TBI. As training data, we are using clinical notes to retrospectively extract patient characteristics. A meta-concept has to be defined in terms of a yes/no question of the form "Does the note mention this patient having...?". Pick meta-concepts that are as specific as possible, without being too broad.

Our team was previously considering the following set of concepts for the CBM:
<question_list>
Does the note mention the patient experiencing a loss of consciousness?
Does the note mention the patient having a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15?
Does the note mention the patient experiencing a headache?
Does the note mention the patient having normal cognition?
Does the note mention the patient being seizure-free?
Does the note mention the patient having a seizure?
Does the note mention the patient having any neurological symptoms?
Does the note mention the patient experiencing a cranial impact?
Does the note mention the patient having a fall incident?
Does the note mention the patient having a history of head trauma?
Does the note mention the patient having tachycardia?
Does the note mention the patient having no vomiting?
</question_list>

Clinical experts gave the following feedback to our concepts:
<feedback>
Rather than using concepts that depend on the status of the patient having neurological assessments, propose concepts that are characteristics of the patient themself.

Some concepts like Glasgow Coma Scale score only make sense if a patient is at least 2 years old, or have different interpretations if the patient is above or below 2 years old. For such questions, write them as a conjunction, e.g. "Does the note mention the patient having a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15 and being at least 2 years old?"

Consider adding questions related to whether a patient has a hematoma and its location on the head.

Concepts they particularly liked or suggested including:
Does the note mention the patient experiencing loss of consciousness?
Does the note mention the patient having a cognitive delay?
Does the note mention the patient having a history of head trauma?
Does the note mention the patient having vomiting or nausea?
</feedback>

We also conducted a data-driven analysis of the top words most associated with TBI as estimated using a logistic regression model with tf-idf features.
Words with top coefficients:

{top_features_df}

YOUR TASK: 
Propose {max_meta_concepts} candidate meta-concepts for a CBM. Do this by revising the original list of concepts, incorporating expert feedback, and incorporating the results from the data-driven analyses. You can merge, revise, or add new questions. Systematically review the feedback and the tf-idf top words list. Prioritize concepts that appear in the tf-idf results and align with the feedback guidance.

Suggestions for generating candidate meta-concepts: 
Do not propose meta-concepts that are simply a union of two different concepts (e.g. "Does the note mention this patient having an infection or being elderly?" is not allowed), questions with answers that are almost always a yes (e.g. the answer to "Does the note mention this patient being hospitalized?" is almost always yes), or questions where the yes/no options are not clearly defined (e.g. "Does the note mention this patient experiencing difficulty?" is not clearly defined because difficulty may mean financial difficulty, physical difficulties, etc).

Concepts that clinical experts have suggested include those relating to loss of consciousness, cognitive delays, history of traumatic brain injury, vomiting, headaches, hematoma characteristics
